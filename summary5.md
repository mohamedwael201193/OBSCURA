# WAVE 5 — Obscura Ecosystem Execution Memory (`summary5.md`)

## ✅ W5-BUG-SESSION — Rate-Limit Bug Fixes + Infrastructure — 2026-05-26

Three bug-fix commits shipped (commits `321f3ba`, `7aa212b`, `b33f415`).
Full infrastructure (Render API + Worker, Vercel frontend, Supabase DB) documented below.

### Bug 1 — Shield hits wrong contract → FHE rate-limit (`321f3ba`)

**Root cause**: `useOcUSDCBalance.ts` line 23 used `CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS`
(old v3.15 credit contract, `0xEFab856b903C4106769B14798deDE21C6923d7d2`) for
all shield/unshield/balance operations. The v3.15 contract is rate-limited by
the CoFHE coprocessor. The correct Wave-5 PAY wrapper is
`OBSCURA_PAY_OCUSDC_ADDRESS` (`0xEd46020Df8abe7BB1E096f27d089F4326D223a53`).

**Fix** — `src/hooks/useOcUSDCBalance.ts`:
```typescript
// BEFORE
const OCUSDC_ADDRESS = CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS;          // old v3.15
// AFTER
const OCUSDC_ADDRESS = OBSCURA_PAY_OCUSDC_ADDRESS;         // Wave 5 PAY wrapper
```

### Bug 2 — Reveal on Overview does nothing (`321f3ba`)

**Root cause**: `PayHarmonyHome.tsx` `onToggle` just flipped a local boolean —
never called `reveal()` from `useOcUSDCBalance`. The FHE decrypt was never
triggered.

**Fix** — `src/components/harmony/PayHarmonyHome.tsx`:
```typescript
// Added reveal() call before showing decrypted value
const { decrypted, reveal, busy: revealBusy } = useOcUSDCBalance();
const onToggle = async () => {
  if (!showBalance && decrypted === null) await reveal();
  setShowBalance((v) => !v);
};
```

### Bug 3 — Shield shows raw viem stack dump on FHE rate-limit (`7aa212b`)

**Root cause**: `OcUSDCPanel.tsx` caught errors and showed `(e as Error).message`
raw — the full viem technical string dumps. CoFHE rate-limits are real on
testnet (per-wallet FHE op quota); retrying fast makes it worse.

**Fix** — `src/components/pay-v4/OcUSDCPanel.tsx`:
- `isRateLimited(e)` helper detects CoFHE quota string
- Friendly message: *"CoFHE rate limited — wait ~30 s then retry."*
- `shieldCooldown` state: 35-second countdown, button disabled + shows `⏱ Ns`
- `startCooldown()` sets interval, auto-clears at 0

### Bug 4 — Stealth send: wrong contract + announce RPC 429 (`b33f415`)

**Root cause (triple)**:
1. Stealth `confidentialTransfer` still used `CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS` (v3.15)
2. `waitForTransactionReceipt` polls RPC ~20 times → exhausts Alchemy free-tier
   budget → immediately-following `announce()` gets a 429 from Alchemy
3. On announce failure, entire multi-step flow dies with no recovery path

**Fix** — `src/components/pay-v4/UnifiedSendForm.tsx`:
- Import `OBSCURA_PAY_OCUSDC_ADDRESS` from `payV3` (remove `CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS`)
- Add `isRateLimited()` and `sleep()` helpers at module level
- Add `withRateLimitRetry` import from `@/lib/rateLimit`
- `await sleep(2500)` between receipt and announce (lets Alchemy rate window reset)
- Announce wrapped in try/catch: on rate-limit, stores params in `pendingAnnounce` state
- New `retryAnnounce()` function: one MetaMask popup just for the announce step
- "Retry Announcement" button rendered in the error block when `pendingAnnounce !== null`
- `reset()` clears `pendingAnnounce`

### Two rate-limit types (important distinction)

| Error text | Source | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"Request is being rate limited"` | FHE coprocessor | Per-wallet FHE op quota | Cooldown UX + friendly message |
| `"RPC submit: Request is being rate limited"` | Alchemy RPC 429 | Receipt polling exhausts budget | 2.5 s sleep + retryable announce |

`writeContractAsync` (MetaMask) **cannot** be silently retried — each retry
requires a new MetaMask popup. Only read calls (`estimateCappedFees`) can use
`withRateLimitRetry`. The UI pattern is: show a Retry button, let the user
re-approve when ready.

## ✅ Infrastructure — Full Deployment Map (2026-05-26)

### Live URLs

| Service | URL | Platform |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | `https://obscura-os-nine.vercel.app` | Vercel |
| API Server | `https://obscura-api-n62v.onrender.com` | Render (free) |
| Worker | `https://obscura-worker-0ppj.onrender.com` | Render (free) |
| GitHub repo | `https://github.com/mohamedwael201193/OBSCURA` | GitHub (main branch) |

### Vercel (Frontend)

- **Project**: `obscura-os` → deploys `frontend/obscura-os-main`
- **Framework**: Vite + React (auto-detected)
- **Root directory**: `frontend/obscura-os-main`
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Output**: `dist/`
- **Auto-deploy**: every push to `main` branch
- **Env vars**: set manually in Vercel dashboard under Project → Settings → Environment Variables
  - All `VITE_*` prefixed vars from `.env` must be added in Vercel
  - Key vars: `VITE_OBSCURA_PAY_OCUSDC_ADDRESS`, `VITE_ALCHEMY_KEY`, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, etc.

### Render (API + Worker)

- **Configured in**: `render.yaml` at repo root
- **API service**: Node.js server in `packages/pay-402/`
- **Worker service**: background job processor (receipt indexer, keeper pings)
- **Deploy trigger**: auto on push to `main`
- **Secrets**: stored in Render dashboard → Environment (NOT in render.yaml — secrets were removed from render.yaml in a prior session)
- **Free tier note**: services spin down after 15 min idle → first request is slow (~30 s cold start)

### Supabase (Database)

- **Project**: linked to Obscura workspace
- **Schema**: stores receipt history, stealth inbox index, user preferences
- **Client**: `@supabase/supabase-js` in `packages/pay-402/`
- **RLS**: Row-Level Security enabled — users can only read their own receipts
- **Frontend reads**: via `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (public anon key, safe to expose)
- **API writes**: via `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (server-only, stored in Render env)

### Chain

- **Network**: Arbitrum Sepolia, chainId `421614`
- **RPC (reads)**: fallback pool in `src/config/wagmi.ts` — publicnode → drpc → omniatech → arb-official → tenderly
- **RPC (writes)**: MetaMask uses its own configured RPC (not wagmi transport)
- **Explorer**: `https://sepolia.arbiscan.io`

### Key contract addresses (Wave 5)

| Contract | Address |
|---|---|
| `OBSCURA_PAY_OCUSDC` (Wave 5 PAY wrapper) | `0xEd46020Df8abe7BB1E096f27d089F4326D223a53` |
| `CONFIDENTIAL_USDC` (old v3.15 credit — do not use for Pay) | `0xEFab856b903C4106769B14798deDE21C6923d7d2` |
| `ObscuraStealthRegistry` | see `deployments/arb-sepolia.json` |
| `ObscuraCreditScoreV2` | `0xe5B0c6c06C0B1fd7d7CD5D2e93997693863d3D4D` |

---

## ✅ WAVE 5 LIVE ON ARB SEPOLIA — 2026-05-23

All Phase 1/2/3/4/5 contracts deployed, wired, and verified end-to-end. Frontend
`.env` updated with real addresses. Keeper bot installed, configured with real
key, smoke-tested against live markets (Chainlink prices fetched, HF computed).

| Contract | Address | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ObscuraCreditScoreV2 | `0xe5B0c6c06C0B1fd7d7CD5D2e93997693863d3D4D` | wired to M-86, M-70-WETH, M-50-OBS |
| ChainlinkPriceAdapter ETH/USD | `0xe3E388b421bfcF558FD46a18eE3b1c27aD1D36B3` | `setPublicFeed(ocWETH)` done |
| ChainlinkPriceAdapter USDC/USD | `0xc65e85926Cb29aaEC74f99cF1591CBa65daa2c4A` | `setPublicFeed(ocUSDC)` done |
| ObscuraTimelock (OZ) | `0x07b7961627f433a1d9001F82Ac4af9F19b9a9E05` | 2-day delay, deployer admin renounced |
| ObscuraGovernor | `0xE4807C9F90a0da8F5B5bafa4361B15ff855b7186` | wraps Vote V5 `voterParticipation` |
| ObscuraTreasuryStreamer | `0x4af75Ae3B46C34B70d6E85FEcDb71E99EC490FeD` | timelock-only controller |
| credit-keeper bot | `packages/credit-keeper/` | DRY_RUN=true, scan verified |
| Governance UI | `/vote` → sidebar **Executable Proposals** | live reads + writes, see Phase 8 |

Deploy txs all confirmed (exit code 0 from both deploy scripts). Real wiring:
M-86 / M-70-WETH / M-50-OBS markets all returning the new Score V2 oracle;
oracle now uses Chainlink adapters instead of broken 1e12 scaler. Keeper
output: `[scan 0xcf98d979] borrowers=1 liqT=9000bps … HF=18000bps ok` — proves
the full read path (market → oracle → Chainlink adapter → HF math) works.

## ✅ W5P1.9 — Premium Fintech UX Refinement — SHIPPED

After W5P1.8 fixed IA, pages still felt crypto-admin. W5P1.9 brings
Stripe/Mercury/Linear-grade polish: state-driven Mission Control, drawer-based
creation, compact density, single dominant CTA per surface.

- **New Harmony primitives**: `HarmonyDrawer` (right slide-in), `HarmonyMissionHero` (state-driven hero w/ ONE primary CTA + progress dots), `HarmonyActionTile` (quick-action), `HarmonyMetricRow` (compact summary strip), `HarmonyActivityRow` (single-line dense row), `HarmonyWorkspaceHeader` (workspace title + "+ New")
- **Home → Mission Control**: PayHarmonyHome rewritten. Single primary CTA driven by 8 onboarding stages (not-connected → active). Sections: Hero → 4 quick-action tiles → compact metric row → 5 recent activity rows → collapsed `<details>` "How encrypted payments work". No more 12-col balance hero, no 5-banner stack.
- **Automations workspace UX**: 3-level pattern — sub-nav (categories) → workspace view (summary + list) → drawer (creation). Each sub-tab (Streams · Escrows · Subscriptions · Payroll) now opens a right-side drawer for the create-form instead of stacking it inline.
- **Density + ivory pass**: `.pay-input` and `.btn-pay` rewritten — ivory `bg-card` + hairline border, 36 px button height, no uppercase, no letter-spacing, no neon glow. New canonical `.btn-pay-primary` (foreground bg). Legacy color buttons neutralized.
- **No contract / hook / FHE / route changes**. Build: `✓ built in 12.84s` — 0 TS errors.
- Full details in `memory_pay_5.md` § W5P1.9

---

## ✅ W5P1.8 — Pay UX Rearchitecture (Sub-Navigation) — SHIPPED

Top-level tabs no longer render stacked workflow cards. Each tab now renders a
`HarmonySubNav` chip strip + ONE active workspace panel (Stripe/Mercury pattern).

- **New primitive**: `HarmonySubNav<T>` in `src/components/harmony/harmony-ui.tsx`
- **Sub-nav layout**:
  - `pay` → Send · Make private · Bridge
  - `getpaid` → Inbox · Setup · Request · Inbound streams (smart default: Inbox if stealth-registered, else Setup)
  - `automations` → Streams · Escrows · Subscriptions · Payroll
  - `settings` → Preferences · Privacy · Contacts · Data · Legacy
- **URL convention**: `/pay?tab=<top>&sub=<sub>` via `history.replaceState` (no reload)
- **Legacy URL aliases preserved**: `?tab=send|receive|escrow|streams|receivables|insurance|contacts|advanced`
- `SettingsCards` split into `SettingsPrefsCard` / `SettingsPrivacyCard` / `SettingsDataCard`
- **No contract / hook / FHE changes**. Build: `✓ built in 16.47s` — 0 TS errors
- Full details in `memory_pay_5.md` § W5P1.8

> **Purpose**: Single source of truth for the Wave-5 cross-product execution.
> Every phase started in this stream is logged here with: what was found,
> what was shipped, what was deferred, what the user must run next.
> If a session ends mid-phase, the next session reads this file to resume.

> **Master plan**: 22 phases (see PAY_STRATEGY / CREDIT_STRATEGY / VOTE_STRATEGY).
> **Pace**: 1–2 phases per session realistically. Some require deployments
> (private key only the user has); contract authoring + script staging happens
> here, the user runs the actual broadcast.

> **🚨 Fhenix mainnet status (verified May 2026)**: CoFHE is **testnet-only**.
> Live networks: Arbitrum Sepolia (our chain), Ethereum Sepolia, Base Sepolia.
> No CoFHE mainnet GA exists. Phase 21 ("audit + mainnet") is therefore a
> **mainnet-readiness gate** — audit, freeze, contract verification, and
> deployment runbook — with the actual broadcast blocked on Fhenix CoFHE
> mainnet launch. Do **NOT** broadcast Obscura to Arbitrum One until then.

## Phase 0 — Codebase audit (✅ COMPLETE)

### What I found

The repo is **far more shipped** than the strategy docs implied. Snapshot:

#### Credit (`contracts-hardhat/contracts/credit/`)
- 16 contracts already authored. v3.18.2 is live with **full FHE audit PASSED**.
- `ObscuraCreditMarket.sol` **already integrates** `IEncryptedScore` for LLTV
  boost in both borrow (line 415–427) and liquidation (line 614–626) paths —
  via `userTier()` (plain bucket) + `scoreOf()` (encrypted score) + `allowTransientForMarket()`.
- `setScoreOracle(address)` exists on the market (line 152). Currently **NOT
  CALLED on any of the 3 deployed markets** (M-86, M-70-WETH, M-50-OBS).
- `ObscuraCreditScore.sol` is deployed at `0xA83aCeE57af79D77cac6854edf92A63A60c28c18`
  but uses **wrong adapter interfaces** for AddressBook/Vote — it calls
  `getContacts()` and `totalVotesByUser()` which **do not exist** on the
  live contracts. Result: score reads 0 for everyone today via silent `try/catch`.
- `ObscuraCreditOracle.sol` has a **scale bug** for Chainlink: `raw / 1e12`
  assumes 18-decimal Pyth-style feeds. Arbitrum Sepolia Chainlink feeds
  return 8 decimals → math underflows to 0 for ETH ($3000 × 1e8 / 1e12 = 0).

#### Pay (`contracts-hardhat/contracts/`)
- 13 contracts live: Pay, Invoice, PayStreamV2, Insurance, ConfidentialEscrow,
  Stealth (Registry + Rotation), AddressBook, InboxIndex, PayrollV2, Underwriter, Rewards.
- `ObscuraPayStreamV2.streamsByEmployer(address) returns(uint256[])` — usable
  as a per-user score signal.
- `ObscuraAddressBook.listContactIds(address) returns(uint256[])` — usable
  as a per-user social-graph signal.

#### Vote (`contracts-hardhat/contracts/`)
- V5 + Treasury + Rewards + OBS token all live on Arbitrum Sepolia.
- `voterParticipation` mapping is **public** → auto-getter
  `voterParticipation(address) returns(uint256)` exists. Score just needs to
  call this instead of the imaginary `totalVotesByUser`.

#### Frontend (`frontend/obscura-os-main/src/`)
- 50+ hooks, 9 pages, naming standardized to `ocUSDC / ocWETH / ocOBS`.
- Gas-preflight, FHE-status, decrypt-balance, shield, unshield all built.

### Decision

The "Wave-5 ecosystem" work is **wire-up + new infra**, not greenfield. Strategy
docs were correctly forward-looking; this memory doc tracks the actual deltas.

---

## Phase 1 — IEncryptedScore activation (✅ CONTRACTS SHIPPED & COMPILED)

### Goal
Wire Pay (stream count) + Vote (participation count) + AddressBook (contact
count) into a corrected score contract, then set the score oracle on all 3
live markets so every borrow picks up an encrypted LLTV boost up to +400 bps
(tier 3 = score ≥ 750).

### What I shipped

**File**: `contracts-hardhat/contracts/credit/ObscuraCreditScoreV2.sol`
(compiles clean against `solc 0.8.25` + `viaIR` — see `npx hardhat compile`).

1. **Adapter interfaces fixed** to match the actual live-contract functions:
   - `IPayStreamV2Score.streamsByEmployer(address) returns(uint256[])` →
     `.length` is the per-user stream count (replaces the bogus global
     `streamCount()` in v1, which made every user score the same).
   - `IAddressBookV2Score.listContactIds(address) returns(uint256[])` →
     `.length` is per-user contact count (replaces non-existent
     `getContacts()` in v1, which silently caught and returned 0).
   - `IVoteV2Score.voterParticipation(address) returns(uint256)` (replaces
     non-existent `totalVotesByUser()` in v1).
2. **Same `IEncryptedScore` external surface** (`scoreOf`, `userTier`,
   `allowTransientForMarket`) → the 3 deployed markets need **zero code
   changes**, just `setScoreOracle(scoreV2)`.
3. **Anti-grind clamps** tightened per source: streams ≤ 50 (×5), contacts
   ≤ 20 (×3, lower because `addContact` is cheap to spam), votes ≤ 30 (×8,
   highest weight because casting a vote requires holding $OBS).
4. **`bumpFromMarket(address user)`** + `setAuthorizedMarket(market, ok)`
   → market can lazy-ping a refresh on first touch.
5. **`updateScore(address)` is permissionless** → anyone (or a keeper) can
   refresh a user's score, but the resulting handle is only ACL'd to the
   user themselves and (transiently) to markets the user has attested for.

### What the user must run

```powershell
# from contracts-hardhat/
npx hardhat compile                                                # ✓ already passes
npx hardhat run scripts/deployWave5Phase1And2.ts --network arb-sepolia
```

`scripts/deployWave5Phase1And2.ts` (single combined script) will:
- Deploy `ObscuraCreditScoreV2(payStreamV2, addressBook, voteV5)`
- Deploy 2 × `ChainlinkPriceAdapter` (ETH/USD + USDC/USD) — see Phase 2
- `setAuthorizedMarket(M-86 / M-70-WETH / M-50-OBS, true)` on Score V2
- `setPublicFeed(ocWETH/ocUSDC, adapter)` on existing oracle (if signer is gov)
- `setScoreOracle(scoreV2)` on each market (if signer is factory)
- Append addresses to `deployments/arb-sepolia.json` under
  `ObscuraCreditScoreV2`, `ChainlinkPriceAdapter_ETHUSD`,
  `ChainlinkPriceAdapter_USDCUSD`, `wave5Phase1And2DeployedAt`

If the deployer is not the factory/gov, the script prints the unsigned
follow-up calls so the correct signer can broadcast them separately.

### Privacy note
- `userTier(address)` returns a **plain uint8** tier bucket (0–3). This
  intentionally leaks the bucket, NOT the raw score, so the market can do
  a public branch on tier without an FHE select. Same trade as today.
- The raw `scoreOf` stays `euint64` and is only transient-authorized to the
  market for the duration of a borrow/liquidation tx.

---

## Phase 2 — Chainlink oracle (✅ ADAPTER SHIPPED & COMPILED — IN-PLACE FIX)

### Goal
Fix the broken 1e12 scaler that returns 0 for 8-decimal Chainlink feeds,
without redeploying the market (oracle is `immutable` in `ObscuraCreditMarket`
storage at line 33 — swapping would require redeploying all 3 markets and
migrating state).

### Architectural decision

**Rejected**: write `ObscuraCreditOracleV2` and call `market.setOracle(...)`.
The market has no `setOracle` — the oracle address is **immutable** in
constructor. A v2 oracle would require a v2 market for each of M-86,
M-70-WETH, M-50-OBS, with full state migration. Too disruptive for a
scaler bug.

**Chosen**: `ChainlinkPriceAdapter.sol` — an in-place adapter that wraps a
Chainlink `AggregatorV3` and exposes the existing oracle's expected
`latestAnswer() returns(uint256)` interface, but re-scales the 8-decimal
Chainlink answer to 18 decimals (× `1e10`). The existing oracle's
divide-by-`1e12` then produces correct micro-USD (1e6) output **with zero
downstream changes**.

### What I shipped

**File**: `contracts-hardhat/contracts/credit/ChainlinkPriceAdapter.sol`
(compiles clean — same compile pass as Phase 1).

- Reads Chainlink `latestRoundData()` (not the deprecated `latestAnswer()`).
- **Staleness gate**: reverts on `block.timestamp - updatedAt > maxStaleness`.
  Default 24h (testnet tolerance); mainnet would tighten to 1h.
- **Non-positive answer gate**: reverts on `answer <= 0`.
- **Decimals auto-detect**: reads `feed.decimals()` at deploy, pre-computes
  `scale = 10**(18 - feedDecimals)`. Works for any Chainlink-shaped feed.
- Exposes `latestAnswer() returns(uint256)` matching the existing
  `IPlainFeed` interface in `ObscuraCreditOracle`.

Then `setPublicFeed(ocWETH, ethAdapter)` + `setPublicFeed(ocUSDC, usdcAdapter)`
on the **existing** `ObscuraCreditOracle` (0x5F0091...) — the deploy script
handles both. No market redeploy, no oracle redeploy.

### Arbitrum Sepolia feed addresses (verified on docs.chain.link)

| Pair | Chainlink feed | Decimals | Adapter target asset |
|---|---|---|---|
| ETH / USD | `0xd30e2101a97dcbAeBCBC04F14C3f624E67A35165` | 8 | ocWETH |
| USDC / USD | `0x0153002d20B96532C639313c2d54c3dA09109309` | 8 | ocUSDC |

(OBS uses the oracle's existing `setConfidentialPrice` path unchanged.)

### What the user must run

Same combined script as Phase 1:

```powershell
npx hardhat run scripts/deployWave5Phase1And2.ts --network arb-sepolia
```

Deploys both adapters and wires them — see Phase 1 section for full output
structure.

### Why this is better than a v2 oracle

1. **Zero state migration** — markets keep their immutable oracle pointer.
2. **Per-asset adapter** — different staleness windows per asset are
   possible by deploying a 2nd adapter (e.g. tighter for a high-vol pair).
3. **Reversible** — `setPublicFeed(asset, address(0))` falls back to the
   confidential-price path; testnet rollback is one tx.

---

## Phase 3 — Live liquidation auctions + keeper (✅ KEEPER SHIPPED)

### What I shipped
- **`packages/credit-keeper/`** — standalone TypeScript bot (viem ^2.21 +
  `@fhenixprotocol/cofhe-sdk` ^0.3 + dotenv, ES2022/ESNext).
  - `src/index.ts` — main loop. Every `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` (default 30s):
     1. `loadMarketCtx` for each market in `MARKETS`. Pulls `loanAsset`,
        `collateralAsset`, `liqThresholdBps` and routes the two assets to
        the deployed `ChainlinkPriceAdapter` (Phase 2) for USD18 prices.
     2. `scanMarket` iterates `borrowersLength` → `borrowerAt` →
        `hasBorrow` → `getPlainBorrow` + `getPlainCollateral` (public
        shadow accessors). Computes off-chain HF in basis points
        (`(coll·px·liqT)/(debt·px)`). When HF ≤ `LIQUIDATION_HF_THRESHOLD_BPS`
        calls `market.liquidationOpen(borrower)`.
     3. `scanAuctions` iterates `auctionsLength` → `getAuction(id)` and
        calls `auction.settle(id)` for expired windows. Bid submission is
        operator-specific and intentionally stubbed (documented).
  - `src/abi.ts` — hand-curated minimal MARKET / AUCTION / ADAPTER ABIs.
  - `src/config.ts` — env loader with required/optional helpers.
  - `.env.example` — RPC, keeper key, markets, auction, adapter addrs,
    `DRY_RUN=true` default, `MAX_GAS_GWEI=2`.
  - `README.md` — privacy boundaries, install, dry-run-first safety,
    operator-side bid integration sketch (cofhe-sdk `Encryptable.uint64`).

### Why this shape
- **No agent private key** → bot bundled as code only, dry-run by default.
- **Plain shadows are public by design** — the keeper uses what the market
  intentionally exposed for liquidation triage and never touches encrypted
  handles (no ACL). Bid amounts ARE encrypted client-side.
- **Bid logic deferred** — naive bids leak money; operators must own their
  policy (encryption key, risk model, position-specific bid).

### Frontend (deferred to Phase 18)
A user-facing Liquidations viewer + sealed-bid dialog is folded into
Phase 18 (sealed-bid tournament UX) — building it twice would duplicate the
`useCofheClient` wiring.

### How to run
```bash
cd packages/credit-keeper
npm install
cp .env.example .env       # paste adapter addrs + keeper PK
npm run scan               # one-shot, dry-run
npm run dev                # continuous, dry-run
```
Flip `DRY_RUN=false` only after a clean dry-run pass.

---

## Phase 4 — ObscuraGovernor adapter (✅ CONTRACT SHIPPED & COMPILED)

### What I shipped
- **`contracts-hardhat/contracts/governance/ObscuraGovernor.sol`**
  - Extends `Governor`, `GovernorSettings`, `GovernorCountingSimple`,
    `GovernorTimelockControl` (OpenZeppelin, already in `node_modules`).
  - **Skips `GovernorVotes`** — Vote V5 isn't `IVotes` (ballots are
    encrypted). Instead overrides `_getVotes(account, _, _)` to return
    `IObscuraVoteParticipation(voteSrc).voterParticipation(account)`.
  - Safe to use the current value (not a checkpoint) because
    `voterParticipation` is a monotone per-user counter — no one can lose
    weight retroactively, and no one can buy weight by acquiring it after
    the proposal opens.
  - `clock()` returns `block.number`; `CLOCK_MODE` returns
    `mode=blocknumber&from=default` so Tally/Snapshot accept it.
  - `quorum(_)` returns a governance-adjustable `quorumVotes` (plaintext
    vote-unit threshold, not a percentage — simpler given the small voter
    set).
  - Full timelock plumbing (`_queueOperations` / `_executeOperations` /
    `_cancel` / `_executor` / `state` / `proposalNeedsQueuing`) wired.

### Deploy script
`contracts-hardhat/scripts/deployWave5Phase4And5.ts` (combined with Phase 5):
1. Deploys `TimelockController` (2-day delay, deployer as bootstrap admin).
2. Deploys `ObscuraGovernor` pointing at Vote V5 + Timelock (votingDelay=1
   block, votingPeriod=50_400 blocks ≈ 3 days on Arb, threshold=1,
   quorum=3 votes for bootstrapping).
3. Grants `PROPOSER_ROLE` + `CANCELLER_ROLE` to the Governor.
4. Revokes deployer's `PROPOSER_ROLE` and renounces `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`
   on the Timelock (no human admin afterwards).
5. Writes `ObscuraTimelock` + `ObscuraGovernor` to `deployments/arb-sepolia.json`.

---

## Phase 5 — TreasuryStreamer (✅ CONTRACT SHIPPED & COMPILED)

### What I shipped
- **`contracts-hardhat/contracts/governance/ObscuraTreasuryStreamer.sol`**
  - Minimal governance-controlled proxy over `ObscuraPayStreamV2`.
  - `controller` is `immutable` and set to the Timelock at deploy.
  - `openStream(InEaddress encRecipientHint, periodSeconds, startTime, endTime, jitterSeconds)`
    is `onlyController` → can only be called by a passed Governor proposal
    after the 2-day timelock delay. Forwards directly to
    `payStream.createStream(...)`, so the encrypted recipient hint never
    decrypts on-chain.
  - `setPaused(streamId, paused)` also `onlyController` for emergency stop.
  - Maintains a `streamsOpened[]` log for off-chain dashboards.

### Why this shape
- The contract intentionally does **not** custody funds. Funding flows
  through cUSDC + the existing Reineira escrow exactly as for any
  PayStreamV2 employer; the DAO just becomes "the employer" via the
  streamer adapter.
- One contract, one purpose: produce a single Governor-executable tx that
  materialises a recurring encrypted payroll/grant stream. Anything more
  (vesting calculus, claim flows) belongs in PayStreamV2, not here.

### Deploy
Bundled with Phase 4 in `deployWave5Phase4And5.ts`. After deploy:
```
ObscuraTimelock          : <addr>
ObscuraGovernor          : <addr>
ObscuraTreasuryStreamer  : <addr>
```
Frontend env additions:
```
VITE_OBSCURA_GOVERNOR=...
VITE_OBSCURA_TIMELOCK=...
VITE_OBSCURA_TREASURY_STREAMER=...
```

---

## Phase 6 — Privy + WebAuthn passkey (PENDING — multi-session)

### Plan
- Add `@privy-io/react-auth` + `permissionless` + `viem/account-abstraction`.
- Wrap `WagmiProvider` with `PrivyProvider` in `main.tsx`.
- Embedded wallet primary, MetaMask fallback.
- 3-step onboarding: Sign in → Pick username → Choose first action.
- This is a large session on its own. Deferred from this stream.

---

## Phase 7 — Paymaster + gas wallet (PENDING — multi-session)

Requires Phase 6. Will use Pimlico or self-hosted bundler.

---

## Phase 8 — Governance UI (✅ LIVE)

### Goal
Surface the deployed OZ Governor + Timelock + TreasuryStreamer in the user-facing
app so anyone holding Vote participation can browse proposals, cast on-chain
votes, and queue/execute through the 2-day timelock. Per user mandate:
**"no mock data, all real, all tested, full UI/UX"** — every read hits Arb Sepolia,
every write goes through wagmi → viem → live contracts.

### What shipped (real, deployed-contract-backed)

#### `frontend/obscura-os-main/src/abis/ObscuraGovernor.ts` (new)
Minimal Governor ABI extracted from the compiled artifact via:
```pwsh
node -e "const a=require('./contracts-hardhat/artifacts/contracts/governance/ObscuraGovernor.sol/ObscuraGovernor.json'); ..."
```
Filtered to the methods + events we actually call:
- Reads: `CLOCK_MODE`, `clock`, `votingDelay`, `votingPeriod`, `proposalThreshold`,
  `quorum`, `quorumVotes`, `timelock`, `state`, `proposalSnapshot`,
  `proposalDeadline`, `proposalProposer`, `proposalVotes`, `hasVoted`,
  `getVotes`, `hashProposal`
- Writes: `propose`, `castVote`, `castVoteWithReason`, `queue`, `execute`, `cancel`
- Events: `ProposalCreated`, `VoteCast`, `ProposalQueued`, `ProposalExecuted`, `ProposalCanceled`

Exports `OBSCURA_GOVERNOR_ADDRESS` / `OBSCURA_TIMELOCK_ADDRESS` /
`OBSCURA_TREASURY_STREAMER_ADDRESS` with env-var fallbacks pointing to the live
Arb Sepolia deploys, plus `PROPOSAL_STATE_LABELS` for OZ Governor's 8-state enum.

#### `frontend/obscura-os-main/src/hooks/useGovernor.ts` (new)
Mirrors the patterns from `useCreateStream.ts`:
- `useGovernorConfig()` — votingDelay, votingPeriod, proposalThreshold,
  quorum @ current block, timelock; 12s refresh
- `useGovernorProposals()` — `publicClient.getContractEvents({ eventName:
  "ProposalCreated", fromBlock: "earliest" })`; derives client-side
  `descriptionHash = keccak256(stringToBytes(description))` (saves a chain
  call vs `hashProposal`); 15s refresh, newest first
- `useProposalState`, `useProposalVotes`, `useProposalDeadline`,
  `useHasVotedGovernor` — per-proposal live reads
- `useGovernorPropose`, `useCastGovernorVote` (optional reason →
  `castVoteWithReason`), `useQueueProposal`, `useExecuteProposal` — all
  use `estimateCappedFees(publicClient)` and **`await
  publicClient.waitForTransactionReceipt({ hash })` before returning**
  so the UI never enters READY before the chain confirms.
- Helpers: `parseProposalDescription` (splits "Title\n\nBody"),
  `useGovernorAddresses`.

#### `frontend/obscura-os-main/src/components/vote/GovernorPanel.tsx` (current)
Self-contained panel mounted inside **VotePage** under the sidebar item
**"Executable Proposals"** (Modules group). Originally shipped as a
stand-alone `/governance` route; that route was removed during the
MASTER_REFACTOR_PLAN.md §2 consolidation — it duplicated `/vote`
chrome. The component now takes a `wrongNetwork?: boolean` prop from
VotePage so it renders the same amber banner pattern as the rest of the
Vote surface. Layout:
1. **Hero** — "Treasury & protocol decisions, on the record" + privacy copy
   ("participation counter is public; encrypted ballots in Vote stay sealed")
2. **Wrong-network banner** if `chainId !== 421614`
3. **4 stat tiles** — Voting period (blocks → hours @ 0.25 s/block),
   Quorum, Timelock delay (2 days), Your voting weight (from
   `useVoterParticipation`)
4. **3 contract chips** with Arbiscan deep-links (Governor / Timelock / Streamer)
5. **Tabs**:
   - *Proposals* — `ProposalCard` per row with state badge (8-color
     `stateTone` map), `VotesBar` (for/against/abstain percentage bar
     computed via `Number((n * 1000n) / total) / 10`), vote buttons (For
     / Against / Abstain, disabled unless `state === "Active" &&
     !hasVoted`), Queue if Succeeded, Execute if Queued.
   - *New proposal* — Title + Body + Treasury Streamer template
     (Recipient / RatePerSecond / Start / End → `encodeFunctionData` on
     the streamer's `openStream(address,uint256,uint256,uint256)`).
     `propose([streamer], [0n], [calldata], "title\n\nbody")`. All
     validation via `isAddress` + digit regex + `endTime > startTime`.
6. **Footer** — "Powered by OpenZeppelin Governor · TimelockController · 2-day delay · privacy-preserved ballots"

All actions toast via sonner with the tx hash short form. All addresses
are click-through Arbiscan links.

#### `src/pages/VotePage.tsx` + `src/App.tsx` + `src/components/elite/GooeyNav.tsx`
- `VotePage` Tab union extended with `"governor"`; new sidebar item
  `{ key: "governor", label: "Executable Proposals", icon: Gavel }` in
  the Modules group; `renderActiveSection` case mounts
  `<GovernorPanel wrongNetwork={wrongNetwork} />`
- `App.tsx`: removed `GovernancePage` import, removed
  `<Route path="/governance" …/>`, dropped `/governance` from
  `DASHBOARD_PATHS`
- `GooeyNav.tsx`: removed `{ key: "gov", … href: "/governance" }` and
  the `"/governance": "gov"` pathToKey entry
- `src/pages/GovernancePage.tsx`: **deleted** (logic preserved in
  `GovernorPanel.tsx` + git history)

### Build verification
```
PS D:\route\Obscura\frontend\obscura-os-main> npm run build
✓ built in 1m 10s
```
Zero TS errors across the three new files. Vite emitted the full chunk graph;
existing 500 kB chunk warnings are pre-existing (wagmi + tfhe + Reown core).

### What's NOT in this phase (intentional)
- **Bid encryption for sealed-bid auctions** — still operator-side, deferred to
  the Phase 18 follow-up.
- **Tally integration** — optional, deferred. Listing on
  https://www.tally.xyz/add-a-dao is a one-time manual step the user can do.
- **Raw multi-call proposal composer** — only the Treasury Streamer template
  is exposed in the UI. Power users can still call `propose()` from the
  hook directly; we'll expose a raw composer if/when demand arises.

### How to test (manual smoke)
1. `cd frontend/obscura-os-main; npm run dev`
2. Connect MetaMask to Arbitrum Sepolia (421614)
3. Visit `/vote` → sidebar → **Executable Proposals** → 4 stat tiles populate with live config
4. *New proposal* tab → fill template → Submit → wait for receipt →
   proposal appears in the *Proposals* tab with state `Pending`
5. After `votingDelay` blocks → state flips to `Active` → cast vote
6. After `votingPeriod` → `Succeeded` → Queue → wait 2 days → Execute

## Phase 9 — PAY UI Migration: cUSDC → ocUSDC (✅ COMPLETE)

### Goal
Align every user-facing text label, toast, badge, card header, and form copy
across the entire PAY + CREDIT + shared frontend with the canonical deployed
token name `ocUSDC` (deployed at `0xf963fD86348813786ed57b8b2778A365C6226E43`).
Also fix a critical 3-arg bug in the unshield flow and migrate `operators.ts`
from the legacy Reineira address to ocUSDC.

### Critical Bug Fixed — `useCUSDCBalance.unwrap()` (1-arg → 3-arg)

**Problem**: Hook called `unshield` with `args: [amount]` — one `uint256`.
Contract signature is `unshield(uint64 amtPlain, InEuint64 calldata encAmt, address to)` — three args.
All unshield transactions were silently reverting.

**Fix** (`src/hooks/useCUSDCBalance.ts`):
```typescript
// Now correctly:
await initFHEClient(publicClient, walletClient);
const encAmt = await encryptAmount(amtPlain);           // encrypt client-side
args: [amtPlain, encAmt, address]                        // 3-arg call
```
File has CRLF line endings — replacement was done via a Node.js script
(`fix_unshield.mjs`) to avoid tool encoding failures.

### `operators.ts` — Reineira → ocUSDC

**File**: `src/lib/operators.ts`

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `import { REINEIRA_CUSDC_ADDRESS, REINEIRA_CUSDC_ABI } from "@/config/pay"` | `import { CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS, CONFIDENTIAL_TOKEN_ABI } from "@/config/credit"` |
| `REINEIRA_CUSDC_ADDRESS` (all call sites) | `CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS` |
| `REINEIRA_CUSDC_ABI` (all call sites) | `CONFIDENTIAL_TOKEN_ABI` |
| `"cUSDC address not configured"` | `"ocUSDC address not configured"` |

### UI Text Migration — 43 replacement pairs across 40+ files

**Pattern**: `cUSDC → ocUSDC`, `Encrypt → Shield`, `Decrypt → Unshield`,
`wrap USDC → cUSDC → shield USDC → ocUSDC`, `encrypted cUSDC → encrypted ocUSDC`

### Pending: Solidity contract layer (Wave 5 Pay Migration)

The UI is fully aligned. The Solidity layer still uses Reineira interfaces
for `ObscuraPayStreamV2`, `ObscuraPay`, `ObscuraConfidentialEscrow`,
`ObscuraInsuranceSubscription`, `ObscuraInvoice`, `ObscuraPayrollResolverV2`.
These contracts must be updated and redeployed before live ocUSDC flows work
end-to-end. Pending tasks:

1. **Add `confidentialTransferFromHandle(from, to, uint256 handle)`** to
   `contracts-hardhat/contracts/credit/ObscuraConfidentialToken.sol`
   (operator-backed handle-based transfer needed by stream/escrow contracts)
2. **Create `contracts-hardhat/contracts/interfaces/IObscuraToken.sol`**
   replacing `IConfidentialUSDC.sol` for ocUSDC-native interface
3. **Update all 6 Pay contracts** — `IConfidentialUSDC → IObscuraToken`,
   `confidentialTransferFrom(euint64) → confidentialTransferFromHandle(from, to, handle)`
4. **Write `scripts/deployWave5PayMigration.ts`** — deploy all updated Pay
   contracts with the new wrapper ocUSDC address,
   update `deployments/arb-sepolia.json`

**Note**: `useInsurePayroll.ts` remains on Reineira intentionally — it calls
external Reineira insurance contracts that cannot be migrated without
external contract changes.

## Phase 10 — Shield/Unshield Fix: ocUSDC Wrapper Deployment (✅ COMPLETE)

### Root Cause

User reported `shield()` transaction reverted: https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/tx/0xbd13437d24d2625a020ce60cb1985d0625d399fe84d4d297328702d13a95aa22

The ocUSDC deployed in Phase 9 (`0xf963fD86348813786ed57b8b2778A365C6226E43`) was a **pre-v3.15 faucet-only contract** that:
- Has no `underlying()`, `guardian()`, or `setUnderlying()` functions
- Always reverts `FaucetModeOnly()` on `shield()` and `unshield()`
- Cannot be upgraded — it is permanently in faucet mode

### Fix Applied

Deployed a new **ObscuraConfidentialToken v3.15** in wrapper mode:

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| New ocUSDC (wrapper) | `0xEFab856b903C4106769B14798deDE21C6923d7d2` |
| `setUnderlying()` tx | `0xcfdd46be49db7b9b1351de93efd5f04b93b2d47bd3b05bbdbd09037da79c5ab5` |
| Underlying (Circle USDC) | `0x75faf114eafb1BDbe2F0316DF893fd58CE46AA4d` |
| Old faucet token | `0xf963fD86348813786ed57b8b2778A365C6226E43` (still valid for `claimFaucet()`) |

### Files Updated

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `frontend/.env` | `VITE_OBSCURA_CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS` → new wrapper address |
| `contracts-hardhat/deployments/arb-sepolia.json` | Added `ObscuraConfidentialUSDCWrapper` entry |
| `contracts-hardhat/scripts/deployWave5Phase1And2.ts` | `OC_USDC` → new wrapper address |
| `contracts-hardhat/scripts/redeployEscrowOcUSDC.ts` | `OC_USDC` → new wrapper address |
| `packages/credit-keeper/src/index.ts` | Price routing accepts both old + new addresses |

### How Shield/Unshield Now Works

1. User has Circle USDC from https://faucet.circle.com/ → `0x75faf114...`
2. Frontend calls `approve(newOcUSDC, amount)` on Circle USDC contract
3. Frontend calls `shield(amount)` on new ocUSDC → pulls USDC in, mints encrypted ocUSDC
4. User's encrypted balance increases; Circle USDC balance decreases
5. `unshield(amtPlain, encAmt, recipientAddress)` reverses the flow

## Phase 11 — Unshield Bug Fix: `Cannot convert [object Object] to a BigInt` (✅ COMPLETE)

### Root Cause

After Phase 10, user confirmed shield (USDC → ocUSDC) worked but unshield failed in-browser with:

```
Cannot convert [object Object] to a BigInt
```

**CoFHE SDK behavior**: `cofheClient.encryptInputs([Encryptable.uint64(x)]).execute()` returns an **array** `[InEuint64]`, not a single `InEuint64` object.

`encryptAmount()` in `lib/fhe.ts` returns the full array result. Most hooks already correctly use `encAmt[0]` to extract the single tuple. But `useUnshield.ts` and `useCUSDCBalance.ts` passed the raw array as the `encAmt` tuple arg to `unshield(amtPlain, encAmt, to)`.

When viem's ABI encoder received an array where it expected a tuple `{ ctHash: uint256, securityZone: uint8, utype: uint8, signature: bytes }`, it tried `BigInt(array[0])` — the whole `InEuint64` object — and threw `Cannot convert [object Object] to a BigInt`.

### Fix Applied

Changed `args: [amtPlain, encAmt, address/to]` → `args: [amtPlain, encAmt[0], address/to]` in both affected hooks:

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/hooks/useCUSDCBalance.ts` | `args: [amtPlain, encAmt, address]` → `args: [amtPlain, encAmt[0], address]` |
| `src/hooks/useUnshield.ts` | `args: [amtPlain, encAmt, to]` → `args: [amtPlain, encAmt[0], to]` |

Build verified passing: `✔ built in 12.34s`

---

## Phase 12 — Unshield Bug Fix: `Fail with error 'supply'` (✅ COMPLETE)

### Root Cause

After the Phase 11 fix, the `encAmt[0]` fix resolved the JS encoding error and the transaction reached the contract. But it then failed with:

```
Fail with error 'supply'
```

**Contract guard**: `ObscuraConfidentialToken.sol` line 269:
```solidity
require(publicSupplyMirror >= amtPlain, "supply");
```

**Diagnosis via RPC**:
- `publicSupplyMirror` on new wrapper (`0xEFab856b...`) = `0x000f4240` = **1,000,000 = 1 USDC**
- Failing tx `0x16639defa9b8f215e3df887bd1deb7a28ff9d23486330c7df4caef1b6595f46f` had `amtPlain = 0x3b9aca00` = **1,000,000,000 = 1000 USDC at 6 decimals**

The user had `1000 ocUSDC` in their tracked/displayed balance (from old faucet claims on the previous contract `0xf963fD86...`) but only shielded **1 USDC** on the new wrapper. The two contracts are independent — faucet-minted tokens from the old contract have no USDC backing in the new wrapper. `publicSupplyMirror` only reflects actual `shield()` calls on the new wrapper.

### Fix Applied

1. **Pre-flight validation in `unwrap()`** (`src/hooks/useCUSDCBalance.ts`): After the user reveals their balance (`decrypted !== null`), `unwrap()` now checks `amtPlain > decrypted` and throws a user-friendly error before sending the tx:
   ```typescript
   if (decrypted !== null && amtPlain > decrypted) {
     throw new Error(`Amount exceeds your ocUSDC balance (${formatUnits(decrypted, USDC_DECIMALS)} available). Reveal your balance first if unsure.`);
   }
   ```
   `decrypted` added to `useCallback` deps.

2. **Max button in `CUSDCPanel.tsx`** (`src/components/pay-v4/CUSDCPanel.tsx`): Appears next to the unshield amount input when `decrypted !== null`. Populates the input with the user's exact revealed balance, preventing over-entry.

3. **"Reveal first" hint**: When `decrypted === null`, the hint text below the unshield input reminds the user to reveal their balance before unshielding.

### Key Architectural Insight

The `trackedCusdc` localStorage key is not contract-scoped. Old faucet activity on the previous contract can leave stale high values. The `reveal()` flow overwrites localStorage with the true on-chain value via `setTrackedUnits(address, plain)` — so `reveal()` is the authoritative step before any unshield. The new validation enforces this.

## Phase 13 — Two-Token ocUSDC Separation: Credits Faucet Fix (✅ COMPLETE)

### Root Cause

`CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS` in `.env` was updated to the new Pay-page wrapper (`0xEFab856b`) as part of Phase 10. However, the Credit market v316 (`0x269f59672F3fd7f95bF440941e618b54Ebc5717A`) was deployed with the **old faucet token** `v314_ocUSDC = 0xf963fD86348813786ed57b8b2778A365C6226E43`. The new wrapper is in **wrapper mode** (`underlying = Circle USDC`) — calling `claimFaucet()` on it reverts with `WrapperOnly()`.

This silently broke:
- Credits page faucet (10,000 ocUSDC drip) — every claim tx reverted
- Credit market supply/borrow/repay — hooks were calling the wrong token contract
- Operator approvals for the credit router — `setOperator()` on wrong contract
- `nextFaucetIn()` on the wrapper returned 0 (last claim = 0 → cooldown passed), making the faucet appear ready in the UI despite the guaranteed revert

### Two-Token Architecture

| Constant | Address | Mode | Context |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS` | `0xEFab856b...` | Wrapper (real USDC backing) | **Pay page only**: shield/unshield, streams, invoices, stealth sweeps |
| `CREDIT_OCUSDC_ADDRESS` | `0xf963fD86...` | Faucet mode (no underlying) | **Credits page only**: faucet, supply/borrow/repay, operator approvals, escrow |

### Fix Applied

**`.env`** — added new env var:
```
VITE_OBSCURA_CREDIT_OCUSDC_ADDRESS=0xf963fD86348813786ed57b8b2778A365C6226E43
```

**`src/config/credit.ts`** — exported `CREDIT_OCUSDC_ADDRESS` from the new env var; changed `CREDIT_TOKENS.ocUSDC.address` from `CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS` to `CREDIT_OCUSDC_ADDRESS`.

**Credit-context files switched to `CREDIT_OCUSDC_ADDRESS`** (8 files total):
- `src/hooks/useCredit.ts` — main credit market supply/borrow/repay hook
- `src/lib/operators.ts` — `isOperator()` + `ensureOperator()` (both read + write paths)
- `src/hooks/useIsOperator.ts` — operator status check
- `src/hooks/useCUSDCTransfer.ts` — credit-context ocUSDC transfer + operator approval
- `src/hooks/useCUSDCEscrow.ts` — credit escrow deposit/withdraw/claim (8 occurrences replaced via PowerShell)
- `src/components/credit/SetupSheet.tsx` — faucet loop (3 tokens array) + per-operator approval
- `src/components/credit/OperatorApprovalModal.tsx` — default token for router operator approval

**Pay-page files untouched** (`useCUSDCBalance`, `useShield`, `useUnshield`, `useInvoice`, `useTickStream`, `useSweepStealth`, `UnifiedSendForm`) — remain on `CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS = 0xEFab856b`.

## Phase 16 — Escrow Token Regression Fix + Legacy Escrow UX + Text Cleanup (✅ COMPLETE)

### Issues Found (via live escrow testing + Arbiscan)

1. **Critical token regression in `useCUSDCEscrow.ts`** — The hook imported and used `CREDIT_OCUSDC_ADDRESS` (`0xf963fD86` — Credits faucet token) for ALL confidential transfers and operator approvals in `ensureOperator`, `create`, and `fund`. On-chain evidence from Arbiscan: `Confidential Transfer` called on `0xf963fD86348813786ed57b8b2778A365C6226E43` (faucet) instead of `0xEFab856b903C4106769B14798deDE21C6923d7d2` (Pay wrapper). Same class of bug previously fixed in Phase 14 for `useCUSDCTransfer.ts`, `usePayStreamV2.ts`, and `useInsuranceSubscription.ts`.

2. **Old escrow IDs in My Escrows** — `migrateGlobalKey` migrated localStorage records from previous wallet sessions/contract deployments into the current wallet scope. Escrows #3 and #4 (created 5/1/2026 against old contract) appeared alongside the new escrow #5, with no visual distinction. The user's "first escrow on new contract" was buried among old entries.

3. **"cUSDC" text bugs in escrow components** — Three UI strings still said "cUSDC" instead of "ocUSDC":
   - `CUSDCEscrowForm.tsx` line 162: "claim the cUSDC"
   - `CUSDCEscrowForm.tsx` line 214: "Lock cUSDC in an encrypted escrow"
   - `CUSDCEscrowActions.tsx` line 244: "transfer 0 cUSDC"
   - `CUSDCEscrowActions.tsx` line 265: "return the cUSDC"

### Fixes Applied

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/hooks/useCUSDCEscrow.ts` | Import: `CREDIT_OCUSDC_ADDRESS` → `CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS`. All 7 occurrences replaced throughout `ensureOperator`, `create`, `fund` callbacks |
| `src/components/pay-v4/MyEscrows.tsx` | Added `OBSCURA_CONFIDENTIAL_ESCROW_ADDRESS` import from `@/config/pay`. Split escrows into `currentEscrows` (matching active contract) and `legacyEscrows` (different/missing contract address). Header badge shows `N active` instead of `N saved`. Legacy escrows collapsed under `<details>` summary with amber warning note and `LEGACY` badge (amber styling) + muted opacity. Added `ChevronDown` icon import |
| `src/components/pay-v4/CUSDCEscrowForm.tsx` | "claim the cUSDC" → "claim the ocUSDC"; "Lock cUSDC" → "Lock ocUSDC" |
| `src/components/pay-v4/CUSDCEscrowActions.tsx` | "transfer 0 cUSDC" → "transfer 0 ocUSDC"; "return the cUSDC" → "return the ocUSDC" |

### Legacy Escrow UX Detail

Current contract escrows are displayed prominently with full emerald styling and `YOU CAN REDEEM` badge if applicable. Legacy escrows (from old contract deployments) are hidden inside a collapsible `<details>` section:

- Collapsed by default with summary: `N legacy escrows from older contracts`
- Amber warning: "These escrows were created against an older contract deployment. Use Fund / Redeem / Refund by ID to attempt recovery."
- Row styling: 40% opacity, muted foreground, `LEGACY` amber badge instead of escrow ID emerald

## Phase 15 — Stream Page UX Polish: Design Fix + Token Label Fix + Wallet Popup Reduction (✅ COMPLETE)

### Issues Found (via live stream page testing)

1. **Purple/violet design** — `SubscriptionForm.tsx` used `violet-500` Tailwind classes for selected states, header icon, and CTA button. Conflicts with Obscura brand (teal/emerald).
2. **Old "cUSDC" token ticker** — `SubscriptionForm.tsx` labels and `StreamList.tsx` subtitle still showed `cUSDC` instead of the correct `ocUSDC`.
3. **4 wallet popups** — Creating a subscription triggered 4 MetaMask confirmations. `createStream` in `usePayStreamV2.ts` called `ensureOperator` to grant the stream contract operator rights on ocUSDC — but since the stream contract's `tickStream` always reverts (selector mismatch: `euint64` as `bytes32` vs Reineira's `uint256`), `useTickStream.tick()` bypasses the contract entirely with a direct `confidentialTransfer`. This made the operator grant unnecessary.

### Payment Verification

**Arbiscan tx `0xf02e617611b5c2abf184a565c1b57fc90cfa2551277667776921fd34803ec79b`**:
- Function: `Confidential Transfer`  
- Contract: `0xEFab856b903C4106769B14798deDE21C6923d7d2` ✅ Correct ocUSDC wrapper  
- Status: **Success** ✅  
Confirms Phase 14 token regression fix is working in production.

### Fixes Applied

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `SubscriptionForm.tsx` | All `violet-500/15`, `violet-500/30/40`, `violet-200/300` → `emerald-500/10/20/25/35`, `emerald-300/400` |
| `SubscriptionForm.tsx` | Header icon: `bg-violet-500/15 border-violet-500/30` → `bg-gradient-to-br from-emerald-500/20 to-emerald-700/10 border-emerald-500/25` (matches other Pay cards) |
| `SubscriptionForm.tsx` | CTA button: `<Button>` with violet gradient → `<motion.button className="btn-pay btn-pay-emerald w-full py-2.5">` (matches system design) |
| `SubscriptionForm.tsx` | Labels: `cUSDC` → `ocUSDC` in monthly label, per-month summary, lifetime cap, description |
| `StreamList.tsx` | Subtitle: `cUSDC · FHE Encrypted` → `ocUSDC · FHE Encrypted` |
| `usePayStreamV2.ts` | Removed `ensureOperator(OBSCURA_PAY_STREAM_V2_ADDRESS)` from `createStream` — stream contract tick is bypassed; operator grant served no purpose |

### Wallet Popup Count: 4 → 3

| # | Transaction | Status |
|---|---|---|
| ~~1~~ | ~~`setOperator` on ocUSDC for stream contract~~ | **REMOVED** — unnecessary |
| 1 | `createStream` (schedule metadata on PayStreamV2) | ✅ Required |
| 2 | `confidentialTransfer` (direct FHE transfer to stealth address) | ✅ Required |
| 3 | `announcePayment` (stealth registry announcement) | ✅ Required |

Note: `ensureOperator` in `usePayStreamV2.tickStream` kept (internal path, separate from subscription flow).

## Phase 14 — Pay-Page Token Regression Fix + Full Pay FHE Audit (✅ COMPLETE)

### Root Cause

Phase 13 fixed the Credits faucet by introducing `CREDIT_OCUSDC_ADDRESS`. However, it **incorrectly changed `useCUSDCTransfer.ts`** to use `CREDIT_OCUSDC_ADDRESS`. This hook is consumed only by Pay-page components (`CUSDCTransferForm`, `StreamList`, `UnifiedSendForm`) — so every direct Pay send now hit `0xf963fD86` (old faucet token) instead of `0xEFab856b` (real USDC wrapper).

On-chain evidence: tx `0xa48fdae9...7cd71d` — called `confidentialTransfer` on `0xf963fD86` instead of `0xEFab856b`.

### Secondary Issues Found

1. **`operators.ts`** — `ensureOperator()` and `isOperator()` had `CREDIT_OCUSDC_ADDRESS` hardcoded. Any Pay-context caller (streams, insurance) was approving the operator on the wrong token.
2. **`UnifiedSendForm.tsx`** — had unnecessary `ensureOperator` calls before both direct-send and stealth-send paths. A direct `confidentialTransfer` never requires operator approval — the caller IS the holder (`msg.sender = from`). These calls were wasted gas and pointed to the wrong token.
3. **`usePayStreamV2.ts`** — both `createStream` and `tickStream` paths called `ensureOperator(...)` without token override → wrong token for stream operator.
4. **`useInsuranceSubscription.ts`** — `ensureOperator(...)` called without override → insurance pool was being approved as operator on the faucet token, not the Pay wrapper.

### Fix Applied — 5 Files

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/operators.ts` | Added optional `tokenOverride?: \`0x${string}\`` param to both `isOperator()` and `ensureOperator()`. Default = `CREDIT_OCUSDC_ADDRESS` (backward compat). |
| `src/hooks/useCUSDCTransfer.ts` | Reverted from `CREDIT_OCUSDC_ADDRESS` back to `CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS` (import + 4 usage sites). |
| `src/hooks/usePayStreamV2.ts` | Added `import { CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS }`. Both `ensureOperator(...)` calls pass `CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS` as 5th arg. |
| `src/hooks/useInsuranceSubscription.ts` | Added `import { CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS }`. `ensureOperator(...)` call passes `CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS` as 5th arg. |
| `src/components/pay-v4/UnifiedSendForm.tsx` | Removed `ensureOperator` import and both call sites (direct + stealth paths). Progress steps renumbered: direct 5→4, stealth 6→5. |

Build verified: `✔ built in 11.68s` (zero errors)

## Phase 17 — Escrow Recipient UX Redesign (✅ COMPLETE)

### Problem

Recipients who received an escrow ID (via claim link or chat) landed on the PAY page and could not find the Redeem button because `CUSDCEscrowActions` was:
1. Buried inside a collapsed `<details>` element ("Manage — Expand ▾")
2. Presented as a "Fund / Redeem / Refund / Inspect by escrow ID" tool — sender-centric copy
3. Required clicking a blocking **Check** button before the Redeem button was usable
4. Showed an amber `AlertTriangle` warning when localStorage had no record for the ID (normal state for a fresh recipient on a new device), making recipients think something was wrong before they even tried

### What shipped

#### `src/components/pay-v4/CUSDCEscrowActions.tsx` (full redesign)

- **Header copy**: "Claim / Redeem Escrow" + eyebrow "Receive · ocUSDC" (recipient-first framing)
- **Description**: "Enter the escrow ID you received. The contract privately verifies your access."
- **Lookup is now optional** — replaced the blocking `Check` button with a non-blocking `Lookup` button using animated `lookupStatus` state (`idle | loading | found | not-found | error`). All three non-idle states render informational messages that NEVER disable the Redeem button.
- **Redeem is always the primary action** — a full-width `btn-pay-emerald` CTA titled "Claim Escrow #N", always enabled as long as an escrow ID is entered. Silent-failure explanation below the button.
- **Context guidance** (three cases):
  - `isRecipientMatch === true` → green "Wallet matches recipient — ready to claim"
  - `isCreatorMatch === true` → blue info box explaining creator wallets return 0
  - `isRecipientMatch === null` → neutral "No local record — that's normal for recipients on a different device"
- **Fund section collapsed by default** — moved into `<AnimatePresence>` + `ChevronDown` collapsible ("Top-up escrow · for senders only"). Senders who need it can expand; recipients never see it.
- **Refund section** — only shown when `isExpired === true` (confirmed by Lookup), with amber styling and `Clock` icon. Not shown by default (doesn't clutter the recipient flow).
- **Auto-fill from claim link** — `?claim=N` param loads escrow ID on mount and shows a `toast.message` ("Claim link detected — enter your wallet and click Claim").
- **TX link** — uses `ExternalLink` icon + cyan styling, consistent with other Pay cards.
- Added `AnimatePresence`, `Search`, `ChevronDown`, `CheckCircle2`, `Clock`, `ExternalLink` imports. Removed unused `DollarSign`. Added `useCallback` for `handleLookup`.

#### `src/pages/PayPage.tsx` (layout promotion)

- Removed `CUSDCEscrowActions` from its `<details>` collapsed section entirely.
- Added a new visible `<Card>` with `CardHeader title="Claim / Redeem by escrow ID"` + eyebrow "Receive · Claim link or manual ID", positioned between "Create an escrow" (senders) and "Request a private payment" (invoices). This makes the card discoverable for recipients who land on the PAY page.
- Card is wrapped in `{!claimId && ...}` — hidden when a `?claim=N` URL param is present (in that case `ClaimEscrowCard` hero handles the flow, preventing duplicate UI).
- Removed the duplicate `<details>` section for "Fund / Redeem / Refund / Inspect by escrow ID" to avoid showing two Redeem UIs simultaneously.

### Build verification

```
No TypeScript errors in CUSDCEscrowActions.tsx, PayPage.tsx
```

### UX before vs after

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Buried in collapsed `<details>` | Visible `<Card>` — first thing recipients see |
| "Fund / Redeem / Refund / Inspect" — sender framing | "Claim / Redeem Escrow" — recipient framing |
| **Check** required to unlock Redeem | Redeem enabled immediately on ID entry |
| Amber warning for missing localStorage record | Neutral info box: "No local record — normal for recipients" |
| Fund form always visible (confusing for recipients) | Fund form collapsed by default |

## Phase 18 — Escrow Share Link UX + Expiry Bug Fix (✅ COMPLETE)

### Problems

1. **No visible claim link after creation** — the success screen had a ghost "Copy claim link to share" button below the escrow ID box that was easy to miss. Recipients were never sent a link.
2. **No way to re-share after dismissing success screen** — `MyEscrows.tsx` had no per-row share button, so if the sender dismissed the success screen they had no way to re-generate the claim link.
3. **Expiry blocks calculated wrong** — `const blocksPerDay = 7200n` used the Ethereum mainnet block rate (12 s/block). Arbitrum Sepolia runs ~0.25 s/block = **345 600 blocks/day**. A "30-day" escrow was expiring in ~15 hours.
4. **Expiry display used same wrong constant** — `CUSDCEscrowActions.tsx` divided block difference by `7200n` for the "Expires in ~Nd" label, showing wildly incorrect durations.
5. **No post-claim success panel** — after a successful redeem the only feedback was a toast (disappears). Users didn't know their balance updated or how to reveal it.

### What shipped

#### `src/components/pay-v4/CUSDCEscrowForm.tsx`

- **Fixed `blocksPerDay`**: changed from `7200n` to `345_600n` — new escrows now have correct 30/7/90-day expiry windows.
- **Revamped success screen** — "Send to Recipient" section moved to the TOP and styled as the primary action (cyan border, emerald CTA button). Full-width `btn-pay-emerald` "Copy Claim Link to Share" button. Text below explains the link flow ("They open it, connect their wallet, and click Claim Escrow"). Escrow ID inline copy moved to a secondary "or share ID manually" line beneath.
- Added Arbiscan "privacy placeholder" note inline on the TX link row.

#### `src/components/pay-v4/MyEscrows.tsx`

- **Added `Link2` share button** per active escrow row (before ExternalLink/Trash icons). Clicking copies the full claim URL (`/pay?tab=escrow&claim=N&contract=0x...`) and shows a `toast.success` confirming the link was copied.
- Added `sharedId` state to track which row shows the `CheckCircle` confirmation.
- Added `toast` from `sonner` import.

#### `src/components/pay-v4/CUSDCEscrowActions.tsx`

- **Fixed expiry display** — replaced `/ 7200n` division with real-time block math: `Number(blocksRemaining) * 0.25 / 86400` (0.25 s/block → actual days). Shows true real-world time remaining.
- **Added `redeemDone` state** — set to `true` after a successful `handleRedeem()` call.
- **Added post-claim success panel** — rendered when `redeemDone && txHash`: emerald card explaining "0.0001 pUSDC on Arbiscan is a privacy placeholder", with a "Go to Dashboard & Reveal Balance →" CTA button.
- Added `ArrowRight` to lucide imports.

### Build verification

```
No TypeScript errors in CUSDCEscrowForm.tsx, MyEscrows.tsx, CUSDCEscrowActions.tsx

### UX before vs after

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Ghost "copy link" button below ID — easy to miss | Prominent cyan-bordered "Send to Recipient" section at top of success screen |
| No way to share after dismissing success screen | `Link2` share icon on every escrow row in My Escrows |
| 30-day escrow expired in ~15 hours (7200n bug) | Correct 345 600 blocks/day → real 30-day expiry |
| Expiry display: wrong days shown | Expiry display: actual real-world time (0.25 s/block) |
| Post-claim: only toast (disappears) | Post-claim: inline emerald panel + "Go to Dashboard & Reveal" button |
| Refund always visible (confusing) | Refund only shown after Lookup confirms expiry |

## Phase 19 — Escrow Contract Redeploy: Correct Token Fix (✅ COMPLETE)

### Root Cause (Critical)

Every `redeem()` on `ObscuraConfidentialEscrow` at `0x889DD94ddBAc614D4A4346bfE5b32a3151578D9A` returned **0 ocUSDC** to the recipient — even with a successful transaction. Root cause confirmed via `redeployEscrowOcUSDC.ts` comments and Arbiscan trace:

- The `0x889DD94d...` contract was deployed with **Reineira cUSDC (`0x6b6e6479b8b3237933c3ab9d8be969862d4ed89f`)** as its `immutable cUSDC` constructor argument.
- The `create` + `fund` flow transferred **ocUSDC wrapper tokens (`0xEFab856b`)** into the escrow's confidential balance — the correct token.
- But `redeem()` called `cUSDC.confidentialTransfer(recipient, paidAmount)` where `cUSDC = 0x6b6e6479` (old Reineira) — the escrow held 0 Reineira tokens, so FHE homomorphically transferred 0.
- **Every claim since deployment returned 0 regardless of which wallet claimed.** The tx succeeds (no revert) because FHE arithmetic on encrypted 0 doesn't revert. Arbiscan showed `0.0001 pUSDC` (privacy placeholder for the transfer event), masking the zero result.

### Fix Applied

The existing `scripts/redeployEscrowOcUSDC.ts` was created for exactly this fix. It was run:

```
Network:  arb-sepolia
Deployer: 0xD208aC8327e6479967693Af2F2216e1612D0171A
Balance:  0.9512943144216196 ETH

Deploying ObscuraConfidentialEscrow with ocUSDC...
  _cUSDC = 0xEFab856b903C4106769B14798deDE21C6923d7d2
  -> 0x5b988CBf9f1b5B479763A5008f52987AA1Af5041
Updated D:\route\Obscura\contracts-hardhat\deployments\arb-sepolia.json
```

| Property | Old (broken) | New (fixed) |
|---|---|---|
| Contract | `0x889DD94ddBAc614D4A4346bfE5b32a3151578D9A` | `0x5b988CBf9f1b5B479763A5008f52987AA1Af5041` |
| `immutable cUSDC` | `0x6b6e6479...` (Reineira — wrong) | `0xEFab856b...` (ocUSDC wrapper — correct) |
| `redeem()` transfers | 0 Reineira tokens (escrow has none) | Actual funded ocUSDC amount |

### Files Updated

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `contracts-hardhat/deployments/arb-sepolia.json` | `ObscuraConfidentialEscrow` → `0x5b988CBf9f1b5B479763A5008f52987AA1Af5041` (auto-updated by script) |
| `frontend/obscura-os-main/.env` | `VITE_OBSCURA_CONFIDENTIAL_ESCROW_ADDRESS` → `0x5b988CBf9f1b5B479763A5008f52987AA1Af5041` |

### Also Fixed in This Phase

**Expiry display formula still using old `/7200n`** — `CUSDCEscrowActions.tsx` line 255 still had the old Ethereum mainnet formula even though Phase 18 intended to fix it. Fixed:

```tsx
// Before (Ethereum mainnet — shows ~1440d for a 30-day Arb Sepolia escrow)
Number((expiryInfo.block - expiryInfo.current) / 7200n)

// After (Arbitrum Sepolia: 0.25 s/block → 345,600 blocks/day)
Math.round((Number(expiryInfo.block - expiryInfo.current) * 0.25) / 86400)
```

With `10,368,000` remaining blocks (30-day escrow on Arb Sepolia):
- Old formula: `10,368,000 / 7200 = 1440d` ❌
- New formula: `10,368,000 × 0.25 / 86400 = 30d` ✅

### Migration Note

Escrows #1–#8 were on the old broken contract (`0x889DD94d...`). They were funded with `0xEFab856b` wrapper tokens but the contract attempts to redeem Reineira tokens → permanently 0. New escrows created after this phase (#1+ on new contract) will correctly transfer funded ocUSDC on claim. Previous escrows cannot be migrated.

---

## Phase 20 — Text Bugs + Invoice Stealth Inbox UX (✅ COMPLETE)

### Trigger

User confirmed all three pay flows work end-to-end on Arbitrum Sepolia:
- ✅ Single escrow + autofund → claim link → another account claimed **1.5 ocUSDC** (tx `0x97ab162121deec526e907ff5a58f1c4ce5fbf79bfacc4a5bd360b30b52d4a673`)
- ✅ Confidential Batch Payroll → 2 escrows → both accounts claimed 0.7 ocUSDC each
- ✅ Request a private payment (invoice) → payer paid → funds reached stealth address

User asked: *"if I pay from another account, will it send direct or should the recipient claim from the Receive page?"*

### Answer

**Invoice payment goes to the creator's stealth address** — NOT directly to their balance. The creator must go to **Receive → Stealth Inbox → "Claim all"** to sweep funds into their main wallet. This is the stealth privacy model: the recipient's real address is never on-chain.

### Bugs Found and Fixed

| File | Bug | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ClaimEscrowCard.tsx` | Header: "private **cUSDC** payment" | → "private **ocUSDC** payment" |
| `ClaimEscrowCard.tsx` | Silent-failure note: "transfers 0 **cUSDC**" | → "transfers 0 **ocUSDC**" |
| `ClaimEscrowCard.tsx` | `daysLeft` still used `/ 7200n` (Phase 18 fix missed this file) | → `Math.round(Number(diff) * 0.25 / 86400)` (Arb Sepolia: 0.25 s/block) |
| `BatchEscrowForm.tsx` | Success: "receive the **cUSDC**" | → "receive the **ocUSDC**" |
| `InvoiceForm.tsx` | Creator success: "funds settle directly to your encrypted balance" (**misleading** — funds go to stealth address) | → "funds sent to your stealth address" + cyan callout: **Receive → Stealth Inbox → Claim all** |
| `InvoicePayCard.tsx` | Payer paid panel: "Funds are now in the creator's encrypted balance" (**misleading**) | → "sent to creator's stealth address"; added cyan guidance: creator must check Stealth Inbox |
| `InvoicePayCard.tsx` | "Your balance" tile: `≈ 3.7` (no unit) | → `≈ 3.7 ocUSDC` |

### Invoice Payment Flow (Documented)

1. Payer visits invoice link → enters amount → clicks **"Pay invoice privately"**
2. **3 transactions** (stealth flow):
   - (1) `ocUSDC.confidentialTransfer(stealthAddress, encAmount)` — funds to stealth one-time address
   - (2) `announcePayment(stealthRegistry, ...)` — encrypted announcement for recipient to detect
   - (3) On-chain receipt flip: invoice status → paid
3. Creator goes to **Receive page → Stealth Inbox** → sees payment → clicks **"Claim all"** → funds sweep to main wallet

The recipient's real wallet address is never published on-chain. Stealth addresses preserve full privacy.

## Phase 21 — PAY Migration: Solidity Layer (✅ COMPLETE)

### Goal

Complete the Wave 5 PAY migration at the Solidity level — eliminate all
remaining Reineira dependencies from every active Pay contract, solve the
CoFHE "forwarding restriction" that broke stream and insurance flows, and
produce clean deployable V3 contracts + a deployment script.

### Problem Discovered — CoFHE Forwarding Restriction

`ObscuraPayStreamV2.tickStream()` tried to receive an `InEuint64` proof from
the employer and forward it into `cUSDC.confidentialTransferFrom()` and
`escrow.create()`. CoFHE cryptographically binds each proof to its **immediate
caller** — forwarding a proof through an intermediary contract causes
`InvalidSigner(address,address)` (selector `0x7ba5ffb5`) at the CoFHE
coprocessor.

This is not a bug — it is a fundamental property of the system.

### Solution — `confidentialTransferFromHandle` Pattern

Instead of forwarding `InEuint64` proofs:

1. Intermediary (stream/insurance) calls `FHE.asEuint64(encProof)` → gets
   `euint64 eAmount` (intermediary IS the immediate caller — this works).
2. Intermediary calls `FHE.allowTransient(eAmount, address(targetToken))`.
3. Intermediary calls `targetToken.confidentialTransferFromHandle(from, to, uint256(euint64.unwrap(eAmount)))`.
4. Token contract reconstructs: `euint64 amt = euint64.wrap(bytes32(handle))`
   — has transient FHE permission from step 2 — calls `_debit` + `_credit`.

### Contracts Changed / Created

| Contract | Change | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ObscuraConfidentialToken.sol` | Added `confidentialTransferFromHandle(from, to, uint256 handle)` | Core enabler for stream + insurance fix |
| `interfaces/IObscuraToken.sol` | **New file** — canonical ocUSDC interface | Replaces legacy `IConfidentialUSDC` + `IConfidentialUSDCv2` for new contracts |
| `interfaces/IConfidentialUSDCv2.sol` | Added `confidentialTransferFromHandle` stub | Backward compat for escrow/invoice |
| `ObscuraConfidentialEscrow.sol` | Added `createFromHandles()` + `fundFromHandle()` | Enables stream proxy pattern without InEuint64 forwarding |
| `ObscuraPayrollResolverV3.sol` | **New file** | Plaintext-commit resolver; no `eaddress`/`InEaddress`; compatible with stream proxy |
| `ObscuraPayStreamV3.sol` | **New file** — replaces broken V2 | Uses `IObscuraToken`, `confidentialTransferFromHandle`, `createFromHandles`, `fundFromHandle` |
| `ObscuraInsuranceSubscription.sol` | Updated import + `consume()` | Uses `IObscuraToken` + `confidentialTransferFromHandle` instead of v1 ABI |
| `scripts/deployWave5PayMigration.ts` | **New file** | Deploys all 5 contracts in order; updates `arb-sepolia.json`; prints `.env` additions |

### `tickStream()` Flow (V3)

```
Employer calls tickStream(streamId, encCycleAmount, encRecipient, ...)
  ↓
stream.FHE.asEuint64(encCycleAmount)    → eAmount   (stream is signer ✓)
stream.FHE.asEaddress(encRecipient)     → eRecipient (stream is signer ✓)
stream.FHE.allowTransient(eAmount, cUSDC)
stream → cUSDC.confidentialTransferFromHandle(employer, escrow, handle)
  ↓ tokens move employer → escrow cUSDC balance
stream.FHE.allowTransient(eAmount, escrow)
stream.FHE.allowTransient(eRecipient, escrow)
stream → escrow.createFromHandles(rcpHandle, amtHandle, resolverV3, data)
  ↓ escrow record created; resolverV3.onConditionSet() stores commit data
stream → escrow.fundFromHandle(escrowId, amtHandle)
  ↓ paidAmount updated in escrow
stream: lastTickTime += periodSeconds; cyclesPaid += 1
```

### Resolver Data Format Change

| Version | Format |
|---|---|
| V2 (broken) | `abi.encode(uint64, InEaddress, InEaddress, bytes32, bytes32)` |
| V3 (working) | `abi.encode(uint64 releaseTime, bytes32 employerCommit, bytes32 approverCommit)` |

`employerCommit = keccak256(abi.encode(employer, salt))` — keeps plaintext
employer address off the resolver storage while still enabling commit-based
auth for `cancel()` and `approve()`.

### Compile Result

`Compiled 17 Solidity files successfully (evm target: cancun)` — zero errors,
zero warnings (after compile run 2026-05-26).

### Post-Deploy Operator Setup (Required)

After deploying V3 contracts, each participant must call once:
```
cUSDC.setOperator(address(payStreamV3), uint48(block.timestamp + 90 days))
cUSDC.setOperator(address(insuranceSubV2), uint48(block.timestamp + 90 days))
```

### New Contract Addresses

Populated after running `npx hardhat run scripts/deployWave5PayMigration.ts --network arb-sepolia`.
See `deployments/arb-sepolia.json` keys: `ocUSDC_Pay`, `ObscuraConfidentialEscrow`,
`ObscuraPayrollResolverV3`, `ObscuraPayStreamV3`, `ObscuraInsuranceSubscriptionV2`.

---

## Phase 22 — PAY V3 Frontend Integration (✅ COMPLETE — DEPLOYED 2026-05-24)

### Deployed Addresses (Arbitrum Sepolia)

| Contract | Address |
|---|---|
| ocUSDC Pay wrapper v2 | `0xEd46020Df8abe7BB1E096f27d089F4326D223a53` |
| ObscuraConfidentialEscrow v2 | `0x293810A2081114CcE0c98A709a0c31aE07c01D75` |
| ObscuraPayrollResolverV3 | `0xB077c231448EF2252060E4B4dD404078DBD94180` |
| ObscuraPayStreamV3 | `0xE4328F139F03138D63f7fdF90A8Ef240e04653fA` |
| ObscuraInsuranceSubscriptionV2 | `0xEA9Fc5800F41d090dFB90f9735F4CF3824d6743D` |

### Goal

Wire all V3 contracts into the Vite/React frontend so that once the user
runs `deployWave5PayMigration.ts`, everything auto-activates with no further
code changes needed.

### Files Changed / Created

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `frontend/obscura-os-main/src/config/payV3.ts` | **New file** — V3 addresses from env, full ABIs (stream/resolver/insurance/ocUSDC) |
| `frontend/obscura-os-main/.env` | Added 5 empty V3 address stubs (see "Post-Deploy Steps" below) |
| `frontend/obscura-os-main/src/hooks/usePayStreamV3.ts` | **New file** — createStream, tickStream (6-param V3), cancelStream, setPaused, getMyStreams |
| `frontend/obscura-os-main/src/hooks/useStreamList.ts` | Updated — now queries BOTH V2 (legacy) + V3 (active), tags with `version: 'v2' | 'v3'` |
| `frontend/obscura-os-main/src/hooks/useInsuranceSubscription.ts` | Updated — prefers V2 insurance address; uses PAY ocUSDC for operator check |
| `frontend/obscura-os-main/src/components/pay-v4/CreateStreamFormV2.tsx` | Updated — routes to V3 when `OBSCURA_PAY_STREAM_V3_ADDRESS` is set |

### Routing Logic in CreateStreamFormV2

```tsx
const useV3 = !!OBSCURA_PAY_STREAM_V3_ADDRESS;
const stream = useV3 ? usePayStreamV3() : usePayStreamV2();
```

When V3 is live:
- Badge changes from "V2" (emerald) to "V3" (blue).
- Description explains escrow-based settlement model.
- localStorage key switches to `v3_stream_recipient_${id}`.
- tickStream uses 6-param V3 signature with auto-operator setup.

### V3 tickStream Frontend Flow

```typescript
// 1. Ensure employer has operator approval on PAY ocUSDC
await ensureOperatorForV3(); // setOperator(streamV3, now + 30d) if needed

// 2. Encrypt both inputs — proofs consumed by V3 stream contract itself
const encAmt = await encryptAmount(cycleAmount);   // InEuint64
const encRcp = await encryptAddress(stealthAddr);  // InEaddress

// 3. Generate random employer salt (stored locally for cancel/approve later)
const employerSalt = makeSalt(streamId, address, saltIndex);

// 4. Call tickStream — contract processes proofs, moves funds, creates escrow
await writeContractAsync({
  functionName: 'tickStream',
  args: [streamId, encAmt[0], encRcp[0], employerSalt, zeroAddress, ZERO_BYTES32],
});
```

### V3 vs V2 getStream Return Order

| Position | V2 | V3 |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | jitterSeconds (uint32) | cyclesPaid (uint64) ← swapped |
| 6 | cyclesPaid (uint64) | jitterSeconds (uint32) ← swapped |

Both ABIs in `payV3.ts` and `useStreamList.ts` document this difference.

### TypeScript Compile Status

```
npx tsc --noEmit   →   (no output = 0 errors) ✅
```

---

### Post-Deploy Steps (USER ACTION REQUIRED)

1. **Deploy V3 contracts**:
```powershell
cd d:\route\Obscura\contracts-hardhat
npx hardhat run scripts/deployWave5PayMigration.ts --network arb-sepolia
```
The script prints all 5 new addresses and auto-updates `deployments/arb-sepolia.json`.

2. **Copy addresses into frontend `.env`**:
```env
VITE_OBSCURA_PAY_OCUSDC_ADDRESS=<ocUSDC_Pay from output>
VITE_OBSCURA_CONFIDENTIAL_ESCROW_V2_ADDRESS=<ObscuraConfidentialEscrow v2>
VITE_OBSCURA_PAY_STREAM_V3_ADDRESS=<ObscuraPayStreamV3>
VITE_OBSCURA_PAYROLL_RESOLVER_V3_ADDRESS=<ObscuraPayrollResolverV3>
VITE_OBSCURA_INSURANCE_SUBSCRIPTION_V2_ADDRESS=<ObscuraInsuranceSubscriptionV2>
```

3. **Restart `vite dev`** — all V3 hooks and routing logic auto-activates.

4. **Shield USDC into the new PAY ocUSDC** (if testing):
   Call `newOcUSDC.shield(amount)` after approving Circle USDC.

No contract re-deploy, no code changes needed after step 2.

---

## Phase 21 (Original) — Audit + mainnet readiness gate (CORRECTED — see Fhenix testnet note at top)

### Goal (REVISED)

The original master plan listed Phase 21 as "deploy to Arbitrum One mainnet."
**This is not currently possible** — Fhenix CoFHE is testnet-only as of
May 2026 (live on Arbitrum Sepolia, Ethereum Sepolia, Base Sepolia per
fhenix.io/blog announcements through Apr 2026). No CoFHE mainnet GA exists.

Phase 21 therefore becomes a **mainnet-readiness gate**, not a deployment:

1. **External audit RFP** (Spearbit / Cantina / Trail of Bits) — focus on:
   - FHE.allowThis discipline across every encrypted mutation
   - FHE.select correctness (no if/else on ebool)
   - Score oracle attestation lifecycle (no transient leaks)
   - Liquidation auction sealed-bid integrity
   - Permit replay + nonce hygiene
2. **Contract verification** on Arbiscan for every live address.
3. **Frozen ABI snapshot** under `docs/abi-snapshots/` per release tag.
4. **Mainnet deploy runbook** written but **not executed**.
5. **Mainnet readiness checklist**:
   - Fhenix CoFHE mainnet announced ✗ (gate)
   - Audit clean report ✗
   - 3-month testnet liveness ✗
   - Treasury multisig configured ✗
   - Upgrade timelock activated ✗

Broadcast unlocks only when Fhenix CoFHE mainnet is GA. Until then, all
production traffic stays on Arbitrum Sepolia.

## Phase 23 — PAY Codebase Normalization + Stream Display Fix (✅ COMPLETE)

### Summary
Pure cleanup pass: 7 file renames (cUSDC → ocUSDC), 11 importer updates, config/pay.ts
de-Reineira, 3 hook internal cleanups, envHealth.ts refresh, and a stream display bug fix.
Zero new features — code quality only. TypeScript: 0 errors throughout.

### File renames (7)
| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `hooks/useCUSDCBalance.ts` | `hooks/useOcUSDCBalance.ts` |
| `hooks/useCUSDCEscrow.ts` | `hooks/useOcUSDCEscrow.ts` |
| `hooks/useCUSDCTransfer.ts` | `hooks/useOcUSDCTransfer.ts` |
| `components/pay-v4/CUSDCPanel.tsx` | `components/pay-v4/OcUSDCPanel.tsx` |
| `components/pay-v4/CUSDCEscrowForm.tsx` | `components/pay-v4/OcUSDCEscrowForm.tsx` |
| `components/pay-v4/CUSDCEscrowActions.tsx` | `components/pay-v4/OcUSDCEscrowActions.tsx` |
| `components/pay-v4/CUSDCTransferForm.tsx` | `components/pay-v4/OcUSDCTransferForm.tsx` |

### Importer updates (11 files)
`PayPage.tsx`, `BatchEscrowForm`, `ClaimEscrowCard`, `SupplyForm`, `InvoicePayCard`,
`StreamList`, `UnifiedSendForm`, `MyEscrows` — all import paths and call sites updated.

### config/pay.ts normalization
- `REINEIRA_CUSDC_ADDRESS` export removed (consumers → `CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS` from credit)
- `REINEIRA_CUSDC_ABI` → `FHERC20_ABI` (generic, same ABI works for all ocUSDC variants)
- `REINEIRA_ESCROW_ADDRESS/ABI` → `LEGACY_ESCROW_ADDRESS/ABI`
- `REINEIRA_COVERAGE_MANAGER_*` → `INSURANCE_COVERAGE_MANAGER_*`
- `REINEIRA_INSURANCE_POOL_*` → `INSURANCE_POOL_*`
- File header comment updated; deprecated V1 exports kept with JSDoc

### Hook internals cleaned
- `useCredit.ts`: `REINEIRA_CUSDC_*` locals → `OCUSDC_*`
- `useInsurePayroll.ts`: all REINEIRA constants renamed; `CONFIDENTIAL_USDC_ADDRESS` now from credit config
- `StakePoolForm.tsx`: same REINEIRA→insurance rename pattern

### envHealth.ts
- Removed dead `VITE_OBSCURA_PAYROLL_UNDERWRITER_ADDRESS` key
- Added `VITE_OBSCURA_PAY_STREAM_V3_ADDRESS`, `VITE_OBSCURA_INSURANCE_SUBSCRIPTION_V2_ADDRESS`

### Stream display bug fix (`StreamList.tsx` + `useStreamList.ts`)
**Root cause**: V2 and V3 stream contracts both issue IDs starting at 0. React keys were
`s.id.toString()` → both V2-stream-0 and V3-stream-0 rendered as "Stream #0", React
duplicate-key warning, display disorder. Pause/Cancel always called V2 contract address
even for V3 streams.

**Fixes applied**:
- Keys → `${s.version}-${s.id}` (e.g. `v3-0`, `v2-0`) — globally unique across contracts
- Sort order: V3 with pending cycles first → idle V3 → V2 legacy last
- Version badge on each stream card: green "V3" badge or grey "V2 legacy" badge
- V2 streams show "Legacy V2 stream — use V3 streams for new payments" instead of pay button
- Pause/Cancel/Resume routed to correct contract address + ABI per `s.version`
- `payAllDue` skips V2 streams (V2 InEuint64 forwarding is broken on-chain)
- "Pay all due" button only appears when V3 streams have pending cycles
- V3 `pendingCycles` clamped: `baseline = lastTickTime > 0 ? lastTickTime : startTime`
  prevents giant pending counts on streams that were never ticked (lastTickTime = 0)

### Git commit
`Phase 23: normalize cUSDC→ocUSDC naming, clean Reineira branding, fix stream display`

## Phase 22 — Continuous ops (PENDING — post-mainnet)

Post-mainnet only. Tracked but blocked on Phase 21 gate.

## W5P1 � Harmony Design System Migration (? COMPLETE)

### What was built

Full migration of Pay frontend from dark-glass / neon-gradient aesthetic to the
Harmony design system (ivory backgrounds, deep-green accent, editorial typography).

#### Track A � Core primitives + routing
- **`harmony-ui.tsx`**: Added 5 new exported primitives:
  `HarmonySelect`, `HarmonyStatusBanner`, `HarmonyFreshnessStrip`,
  `HarmonyRevealChip`, `HarmonySuccessChip`
- **`PayPage.tsx`**: Replaced `PrettySelect` ? `HarmonySelect`; swapped tab
  `"insurance"` ? `"receivables"`; added `<ReceivablesHub>` routing case
- **`PayHarmonyTabShell.tsx`**: Added `"receivables"` tab type + metadata
- **`MyPolicies.tsx`**: Removed dark-glass patterns (icon containers, card bg)
- **`SubscriptionForm.tsx`**: Plain-language copy ("Recurring payment", not "Confidential subscription")

#### Track B � Dashboard rebuild
- **`PayHarmonyHome.tsx`**: Full rewrite �
  - Time-aware greeting (`getGreeting()` ? Good morning/afternoon/evening)
  - Network mismatch detection + `HarmonyStatusBanner` ("Switch to Arbitrum Sepolia")
  - CoFHE degradation banner (dismissible amber warning, off by default)
  - `HarmonyFreshnessStrip` with `checkedAt` state + `handleRefreshActivity`
  - Quick-send card fixed: removed inverted dark bg, step pills use `bg-muted`
  - Benefit-first lifecycle copy (plain English, no ZKPoK/CoFHE/Threshold jargon)
  - Inbox action button shows when `unread > 0`

#### Track C � Component polish
- **`PayHomeDashboard.tsx`**: Full rewrite � 3-step onboarding checklist,
  7-day auto-hide (localStorage), clean Harmony card styles, no more
  "Quick actions"/"How it works"/"Receipts" sections (moved to parent)
- **`StreamsDashboard.tsx`**: Removed neon glow shadow from active tab class
- **`HarmonyEncryptedValue.tsx`**: Added 5-minute reveal session timer with
  `HarmonyRevealChip` countdown chip; auto-hides at 0; cleans up on unmount

### Dark patterns removed
- `bg-[#0a0d12]` on PrettySelect options
- `shadow-[0_0_10px_rgba(52,211,153,0.08)]` neon glow
- `bg-white/[0.025]` dark glass on MyPolicies cards
- Inverted `bg-foreground text-background` card in quick-send section

### Technical jargon removed from UI copy
- "CoFHE-encrypted" ? "encrypted"
- "ZKPoK / FHE.transfer / Threshold network" ? plain lifecycle step names
- "Confidential subscription" ? "Recurring payment"

---

## W5P2 � Receivables Hub (? COMPLETE)

### What was built

**`ReceivablesHub.tsx`** (`src/components/pay-v4/ReceivablesHub.tsx`)

Unified Receivables tab that replaces the old Insurance tab. Accordion-style
layout with four collapsible sections:

1. **Recurring payments** � live subscription list from `useInsuranceSubscription`,
   shows cycle progress bar, last consumed date, active/inactive badge, refresh
   button, and empty state with CTA to Streams tab
2. **New recurring payment** � inline `<SubscriptionForm />`
3. **Coverage & policies** � `<BuyCoverageForm />` + `<MyPolicies />` with
   section eyebrow labels
4. **Dispute & liquidity** � `<DisputeForm />` + `<StakePoolForm />` with LP
   yield framing

All sections use Harmony primitives: `rounded-2xl hairline bg-card`, `bg-muted`
icon containers, no dark-glass patterns, no FHE jargon.

### Build result

`? built in 56.27s` � zero TypeScript errors, zero warnings (except expected
chunk size advisory on large vendor bundles).

---


## W5P1.9.1 � Full-Width Button & Neon Token Sweep ?

All 18 pay component files audited. Removed w-full from .btn-pay* usages, replaced neon/dark tokens with Harmony equivalents (g-card, hairline, g-muted), standardised CTA footer to lex justify-end pt-3 border-t border-border/60.

**Build**: ? built in 13.16s � zero TS errors.

---

## W5P1.9.2 � Privacy Mission Control Overview Redesign ?

PayHarmonyHome.tsx fully rewritten. New design:

- **Privacy posture chip strip** at top of hero card (Lock / Send / Inbox)
- **Embedded CipherBalanceDisplay** inside hero � large cipher-shimmer ������ with AnimatePresence reveal toggle; NO auto-decrypt on mount
- **5-step onboarding rail** card with individual step rows, progress bar, active-step CTAs
- **4 quick-action tiles** (Send / Request / Automate / Make private)
- **Activity feed** � recent 5 rows with empty state
- Removed: HarmonyMissionHero, HarmonyMetricRow, HarmonyPrivacyPosture, "How it works" collapsible, learnOpen state
- Tighter density: space-y-4
- New inline primitives: PostureChip, CipherBalanceDisplay, OnboardingStepRow

**Build**: ? built in 13.16s � zero TS errors.
